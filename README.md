# GettingAndCleaningData_Project

This repository contains three files related to a course assignment:
  1. run_analysis.R - the script performing a process of cleaning on a set of data.
  2. CodeBook.md - the code book describing the data and the cleaning process (although very tersely... I admit).
  3. OutputTidyDataSet.txt - the data set outputted by the script run_analysis.R
